# Magic Meeple...the Boardgame People!
**Magic Meeple Games, LLC.** is an independent tabletop games design, development, & publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. Officially formed in 2015, MMG was co-founded and currently co-owned by husband/wife team Ian Stedman and Trish Stedman who have over 20 years of combined involvement in various games industries.

## We love games.

and

## We believe that games should:

- _**Be Fun**_
- _**Be Entertaining**_
- _**Be Intellectually Stimulating**_

Mission statements can be useful, but are very thin and usually vague. We prefer to build our company and grow based on a few simple principles...

**Respect**
_“Be silly, be honest, be kind.”_– _Ralph Waldo Emerson._  

Good customer service begins with this one simple thing. It does us no good to be dishonest, rude, or take ourselves too seriously. We’re all human beings that deserve respect, so it is our endeavor to extend that same respect to others as we would hope they would show to others (and still keep a sense of humor at the end of the day!) We will endeavor to always put our passion before profits and remain true to our core values as individuals and a business.

**Honor**
_“Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.”_ – _Maya Angelou_  

Just as we are all humans that deserve respect, no one is perfect and mistakes happen. We must strive to do the best we can as Designers, Developers, and Publishers; be transparent with our stakeholders; and most of all own the mistakes we make and endeavor to do better, in all things.

**Fun**
_"Life is more fun if you play games."_ - _Roald Dahl_  

Game time is family time and studies have shown over and over again [how board games can be very good for you](https://www.google.com/search?q=health+benefits+of+board+games&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS761US761&oq=health+benefits+of+board+games&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60j0l2.4043j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). We believe that the Age printed on a game's box should reflect the safety and useability of a product _without adult supervision_. But, _with adult supervision_, even games labeled for Ages 14+ can--and sometimes _should_--be enjoyed by much younger children with responsible family members to help foster inclusion and togetherness, which is what having fun is all about. We must endeavor to never, ever lose sight of this.

**Creation**
_"Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sauté it, whatever. MAKE"_ - _Joss Whedon_  

But most of all, we must never forget why we started doing all this in the first place: to be creative, make games, try new ideas, have fun, and bring people together. To love what we do and do what we love is why we are here! Nobody knows how we will evolve or what kinds of things we'll eventually decide to create, but if it is fun and engaging to us, we're confident it will be for you as well!

# The (brief version of the) History of Magic Meeple Games

A long time ago, Magic Meeple Games founders Ian Stedman and Trish Stedman wanted to start a business. Something outside of the everyday, something relevant to their passions and interests as gamers and business-people. Landing on a target was not easy, and Magic Meeple Games went through several transformations before it became what you see today. Our humble beginnings in 2006 took the form of a video game training and tournament organizer called Gamer’s University, which later became a news and review outlet covering new relevant board and video games. G.U. Games arose when co-founder Ian Stedman changed his focus to board game design and through much hard work, soon became a published designer. In 2015 we shifted our focus completely and now we want to bring more awesome games made by all kinds of designers into the world.

Magic Meeple Games began when our good friend, and Gamelyn Games founder, Michael Coe approached us to co-publish a project with him so they could focus on other projects. It was an idea we had been entertaining joining the industry for over a year as more than just a designer and he encouraged us to break in…and break in we did! Magic Meeple Games debuted with their first project, Darkrock Ventures, designed by the very same Michael Eskue of Council of Verona/TableTop fame.

Our publishing history may be just beginning but with over 20 years of involvement and experience in the board games industry, we aren’t new. Just a new name, a new focus, and a new style.
