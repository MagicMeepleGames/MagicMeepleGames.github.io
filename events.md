Trish and Ian were honored to be invited as Guests of Honor at Penguicon in Michigan, May 4-6. This also happens to be Overworld designer Nemo Rathwald's hometown convention, so fans had their first chance to meet all three together! 

This was especially exciting for Magic Meeple, as we presented an entire series panels and how-to discussions, which isn't normally something we have the extra time to do while demoing games, running a booth, etc. But it isn't every convention that we're there as special guests, either! 

Previous special guests at this convention include the likes of Cory Doctorow (author, Little Brother. BoingBoing.net writer) and Ernest Cline (author, Ready Player One) and Gaming industry heavy hitters like Steve Jackson and Andy Looney. 

We got to meet so many of you in the Michigan area that we haven’t met before at Penguicon! Thank you so much for making us feel so welcome. It was our great honor to be your Guests of Honor for the weekend. You helped us put the Pre-Production Proof Copy of Overworld through its paces, and showed us where the weaknesses in the manufacturing are so they can be improved while there is still an opportunity to do so.
